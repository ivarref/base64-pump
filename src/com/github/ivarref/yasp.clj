  "Do the proxying!

  Move bytes from `data` to the requested remote host and port.

  Arguments
  =========

  `cfg` should be a map with the following keys:

  `:allow-connect?`: a function taking a map with the keys `:host` and `:port`.
  Return `nil` or `false` to block the connection request.
  Example function that allows all connections for port 22:
  (fn [{:keys [_host port]}]
    (= 22))
  This key is required.

  `:socket-timeout`: Socket timeout for read operations in milliseconds.
  The client may override this setting when connecting.
   Default value is 100.

  `:connect-timeout`: Connect timeout in milliseconds.
  The client may override this setting when connecting.
  Default value is 3000.

  `:chunk-size`: Size of buffer to use.
  The client may override this setting when connecting.
  Default value is 65536.
