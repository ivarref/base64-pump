(defn proxy!
  "Do the proxying!

  Move data to the requested remote host and port.

  This function should be invoked by the web server upon receiving a JSON HTTP POST request.

  The first argument, `cfg`, should be controlled by the server side.
  It contains details about which remote hosts can be accessed, whether
  to require mTLS, etc. See details below for what's possible.

  The second argument, `data`, should be the JSON request in the form of a map
  with the keys :op, :session, :payload, etc. This value should originate from
  the yasp client. The details are internal to yasp.

  Arguments
  =========

  `cfg` should be a map with the following keys:

  `:allow-connect?`: a function taking a map with the keys `:host` and `:port`.
  Return `nil` or `false` to block the connection request.
  Example function that allows all connections for port 22:
  (fn [{:keys [_host port]}]
    (= 22 port))
  This key is required.

  `:socket-timeout-ms`: Socket timeout for read operations in milliseconds.
  The client may override this setting when connecting.
   Default value is 100.

  `:connect-timeout-ms`: Connect timeout in milliseconds.
  The client may override this setting when connecting.
  Default value is 3000.

  `:chunk-size`: Size of buffer to use.
  The client may override this setting when connecting.
  Default value is 65536.
